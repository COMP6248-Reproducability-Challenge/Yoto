# Weights

This is the folder where the weights are saved, the weights are saved in the format

For the yoto CIFAR10
"encCIFAR10Yoto_x{}.weights", where the variable is the encoder width
"decCIFAR10Yoto_x{}.weights", where the variable is the decoder width

for the bVAE fixed weights CIFAR10
"encCIFAR10BVAE{}_x{}.weights", where the variables are the beta, encoder width
"decCIFAR10BVAE{}_x{}.weights", where the variables are the beta, decoder width

For the yoto SHAPES
"encSHAPESYoto_x{}.weights", where the variable is the encoder width
"decSHAPESYoto_x{}.weights", where the variable is the decoder width

For the bVAE fixed weights SHAPES
"encSHAPESBVAE{}_x{}.weights", where the variables are beta, encoder width
"decSHAPESBVAE{}_x{}.weights", where the variables are beta, decoder width
